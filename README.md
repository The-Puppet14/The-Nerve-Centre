DISCLAIMER! Most of the skills / Topics that this repo focus on (e.g. Cybersecurity) are of a legally sensitive nature, and therefore should be treated with respect and responsibility. Remember the spider man quote! I am not gonna take liability for your messups, so don't be a Pillock / Skid! This stuff is sensitive, and I dont want people ruining it for others while ending up in legal trouble. Thank you very much!
