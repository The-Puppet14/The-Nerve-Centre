Please note that a lot of the stuff in this 
repo requires you to be responsible and
appropriate when using it, due to the nature
of things like cybersecurity and drone piloting.
Regulations for these things are tight enough,
so don't do snything illegal or be a pillock or
you risk legal trouble and pissing off loads of
people. Thanks!
